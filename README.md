# Features & Bugs #

This is an app based on the reflection exercise Roses & Thorns. 

Features are to highlight a success or something positive that happened

Bugs are to share a challenge that was experienced or something that didn't go so well.

Users can share a Feature without sharing a Bug, but if they want to share a Bug, they must also share a Feature.

Users will be able to see all the Features and Bugs that have been added to the app, but will not be able to see the name of the user that added them. Someone who does not have an account on the app will only be able to see a dashboard on the homepage with the ten most recently added Features and Bugs.

Users will also be able to keep track of the Features and Bugs they have added through a personal dashboard.
